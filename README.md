# Reverse-It
A simple game with digits. 

# How to
A program creates an array that can hold 9 integer values and randomly puts there numbers 1 through 9 without duplicates. Allows the user to type in a number 1 through 9. Whatever 
the user types in, it reverses that many numbers, starting from the left.

For example we have the following numbers subsequence:
5 3 8 6 4 1 2 9 7

If the user types 4 the result will be the following:
6 8 3 5 4 1 2 9 7

The player can keep typing in numbers reversing the indicated part of the array until the array turns out in ascending order. When this happens, the player has won the game, and 
the game ends.
